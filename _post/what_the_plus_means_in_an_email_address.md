Greetings,

I would like to introduce an innovative method you can utilize with your email to enhance your experience. When registering for various services, it is common to receive numerous promotional emails that clutter your inbox. To manage this, try appending a unique identifier to your email address during the sign-up process. For instance, when signing up for Spotify, use yourname+spotify@example.com.

This technique allows you to track if the service shares your email with third parties. If you receive an email from an unfamiliar source, you can inspect the "To:" section of the email. If it shows yourname+spotify@example.com, you will know that Spotify has potentially shared your email address.

Furthermore, this method can assist you in organizing and categorizing your emails more efficiently. By using distinctive identifiers for different services, you can easily sort and manage your inbox.

I highly recommend leveraging this strategy to gain better control over your email communications.
